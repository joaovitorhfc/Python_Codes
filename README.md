# üêç python_codes

Welcome to python_codes ‚Äî a collection of Python programs focused on logic, problem solving, and clean code practices.  
This repository was developed using Visual Studio Code and is meant to explore the power and simplicity of Python for algorithms, data structures, and everyday coding experiments.

## üöÄ About the Project

The goal of this repository is to practice and document different Python concepts through hands-on coding.  
It includes a variety of scripts and modules that cover topics such as:

- Data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)
- File handling and automation
- Object-oriented programming
- Practical problem-solving examples

Each file is independent and well-structured for easy understanding and testing.
